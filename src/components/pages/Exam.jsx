 <h4 className="mt-5">Challenges and Future of Medicine in Nepal
</h4>
<span className="arrowed">Despite the progress made in the field of medicine in Nepal, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the major challenges is the shortage of healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas. This has led to a significant gap in access to quality healthcare for people living in remote areas.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span className="arrowed">Another challenge is the lack of funding for research and development in medicine. This has hindered the growth of medical technology and innovation in Nepal.
